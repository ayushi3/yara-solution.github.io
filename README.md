# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# Installation Steps:

1. Install Node.js: To run a ReactJS program, you must first install Node.js on your system. You can download the latest version of Node.js from the official website https://nodejs.org/en/download/ and follow the installation instructions.

2. Create a React App: Once Node.js is installed, you can create a new React app using the create-react-app command. Open the command prompt and run the following command:
   npx create-react-app my-app
   This command will create a new React app with the name 'my-app' in the current directory.

3. Install dependencies: Navigate to the 'my-app' directory using the command prompt and install the required dependencies by running the following command:
   npm install
   This command will install all the required dependencies for your React app.

4. Run the React App: Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the React app by running the following command:
   npm start
   This command will start the development server and open your React app in the default browser at http://localhost:3000.
